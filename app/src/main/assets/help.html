            <p><strong>Why aren't my auto messages sending ?</strong></p>
                    <p>
                     1. First of all, make sure you have checked the "Auto wish SMS" box and turned on 'Auto wish SMS' from Setting.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    2. Please make sure you have given permission to send message. If not simply
                    go to: <b>Settings > Apps > Birthday Helper > Permissions </b>
                  </p> 
                  <p>
                    3. Sending message may require your sms charge permission. To make sure that please save the numbers into your contact list too.
